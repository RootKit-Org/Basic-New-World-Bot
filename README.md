Join teh Discord - https://discord.gg/rootkitorg

### Known Bug(s)... I mean Features
- Works out of the box when being ran at 1920x1080. May need tweeking at other resolutions (Thanks @[PC/SEA]sniperSHOT)

### Prereqs
1. Download the project by clicking on the green "code" button torward the top right of this repo. A drop down will appear, click the option to 'Download ZIP'

2. Unzip the file and place the folder somewhere easy to access

3. Make sure you have a pet Python (aka install python) - https://youtu.be/N7r8_HVqqy8

4. (Windows Users) Open up either `PowerShell` or `Command Promt`. This can be done by pressing the Windows Key and searching for one of those applicaitons.

5. Copy and past the commands below into your terminal. This will install the Open Source packages needed to run the program.
```
pip install PyAutoGUI
pip install PyDirectInput
pip install Pillow
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install bettercam
pip install pywin32
```
OR, just run the following
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

***IF YOU GET THE FOLLOWING ERROR `python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file` Watch This: https://youtu.be/E2HvWhhAW0g***

***IF YOU GET THE FOLLOWING ERROR `pip is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file` Watch This: https://youtu.be/zWYvRS7DtOg***

5. New World must be installed and running..... But you know this already right?

### Run
If you have python and the additional packages installed you are good to go. Load up New World on your MAIN monitor (Only applicable for people with multiple monitors), enter the game and walk to a nice farming spot, then do the following.

1. (Windows Users) Open up either `PowerShell` or `Command Promt`. This can be done by pressing the Windows Key and searching for one of those applicaitons.

2. Type `cd ` (make sure you add the space after the cd or else I will call you a monkey)

3. Drag and drop the folder that has the bot code onto the terminal

4. Press the enter key

5. Type `python main.py`, press enter and that is it!
