### Prereqs
Make sure you have a pet Python - https://www.python.org/

Make sure you pip install the following packages
```
pip install PyAutoGUI
pip install PyDirectInput
```

New World must be installed and running..... But you know this already right?

### Run
If you have python and the 2 packages you are good to go. Load up New World on your MAIN monitor (Only applicable for people with multiple monitors), enter the game and walk to a nice farming spot, then run the program.
```
python main.py
```
